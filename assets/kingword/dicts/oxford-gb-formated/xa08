Notice the difference between little/few and a little/a few. 注意little/few和a little/a few这两组词的区别. If we say, `I have little money and few interests', we sound disappointed and negative. 若说
*｀I have little money and few interests（我没有什么钱, 也没有什么爱好）＇, 言犹怅然若失, 含否定义. If we say, `I have a little money and a few interests', we sound more positive. 若说
*｀I have a little money and a few interests（我有点儿钱, 也有些爱好）＇, 则含肯定义. Compare 试比较
*He's lived here a long time but has few friends （他在这儿住了很长时间, 可是没什么朋友）和He's lived here a short time but already has a few friends （他在这儿住得时间很短, 可是已经有些朋友了）. 2A lot of can also be used in questions *a lot of 亦可用于疑问句
*Have we got a lot of time/cards left? （我们剩下的时间[卡片]多不多?） It suggests that the speaker knows that there is/are some left and wants to know whether the amount/number is big or small. 这句话的含义是发问者知道有些剩余, 还想知道剩余的数量是多是少. 3The comparative and superlative forms of much, many, and a lot of are more and (the) most. *much、many、a lot of的比较级是more, 最高级是(the) most. For little the comparative and superlative forms are less and (the) least and for few they are fewer and (the) fewest. *little的比较级是less, 最高级是(the) least; few的比较级是fewer, 最高级是(the) fewest.
