6 metres long and
3 metres wide. 汽车房长6米, 宽3米. When describing a piece of furniture that has a front and a back, both length and width can be used for the longer sides and depth is used for the measurement from front to back. 在形容一件有前後之分的家具时, length和width均可用以指较长的边, 而depth（深度）则指从前面到後面的尺寸. Length is generally used when the measurement of the front is much greater than that of the depth. 若前面的长短远远超过深度, 一般用length. *Width is used when the measurements of the front and of the depth are similar. 若前面的长短与深度相似, 则用width.
